        Thank you soo much for your time and dedication in hosting us for our annual retreat. It was amazing to talk to and learn from so many people from the field team working directly with the recipients. The field trip on Thursday was insighful, the lunch at the office was out of this world and the team dinner was amazing.

        Chris and Sarah: thank you for all your help in getting hotel quotes, booking our accommodations, booking office rooms for us, and I'm sure so much more behind the scenes that I didn't see. We loved our stay at Ufulu Gardens and all the logistics were so smooth!

        From organizing the field trip to sharing your beautiful culture and ensuring our comfort (and being well-fed!) at every turn, your support has made me feel truly at home.

        The opportunity to connect with the team on the ground, understand the nuances of your work, and witness firsthand the difference we are making in the lives of recipients and communities, has left me genuinely inspired and excited for the work we'll be doing together.
